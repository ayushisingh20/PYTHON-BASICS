# PYTHON-BASICS

# Python:
Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured, object-oriented and functional programming. 

# Data Types:
Data types in Python specify the type of values a variable can hold. Examples include integers, floating-point numbers, strings, booleans, lists, tuples, and dictionaries.

# Variables:
Variables in Python are used to store and manage data. They are assigned values using the assignment operator '='. Variables provide a way to refer to and manipulate data within a program.

# Basic Input-Output Operations:
Python provides functions like input() for receiving user input and print() for displaying output. These operations are fundamental for interaction with users.

# Basic Operators:
Python supports various operators for performing operations on variables. These include arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), comparison operators (==, !=, <, >), logical operators (and, or, not), and bitwise operators (&, |, ^, <<, >>).

# Boolean Values:
Boolean values in Python represent either True or False. They are crucial for making decisions in conditional statements and loops.

# Conditional Execution:
Conditional statements, such as if, elif, and else, enable the execution of different code blocks based on specified conditions. They allow for decision-making in a program.

# Loops:
Loops, like for and while, enable the repetition of a block of code. They are essential for automating repetitive tasks and iterating over data structures.

# Lists and List Processing:
Lists are versatile data structures that can store multiple items. List processing involves operations like adding, removing, and accessing elements within a list.

# Logical and Bitwise Operations:
Logical operations (and, or, not) manipulate boolean values, while bitwise operations (&, |, ^, <<, >>) operate on binary representations of numbers.
